Talent Connector
I am glad to introduce about a unique platform where students, job-seekers and other talented individuals who want to experience real life
 interview and discuss their project details with experts of that particular field of project. The website is divided into two parts : One
 for the experts or you can say interviewers and other for the people having innovative ideas.There will be an expert column in which HR 
Managers, CEOs will create their accounts by filling basic details and providing verification documents as per the privacy policy so that 
users can get accurate guidance. Other column will be for those who want to schedule virtual interview with an expert or ask to check his 
work/ideas by sharing documents. They can search an expert by name or field and can book one on one meeting by paying nominal online fees
 which will be decided by the interviewer. In meetings, people can discuss their ideas with field experts. Experts can guide them by 
highlighting their mistakes and provide them guidance to end up with a successful project. There maybe possibility that an individual 
will have a totally innovative and applicable idea and expert is also agree, then he can directly offer him job in his company or refer
 his name for a position. By this, talented and competent individuals from low backgrounds and small colleges can get top level positions
 in multinational organizations because of their abilities and hard-work.
